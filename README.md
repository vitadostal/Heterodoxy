# Proportion of belief and ritual in inquisition records: Toulouse register (1273-1282) from the perspective of computational text analysis

This project focuses on the analysis of the Toulouse Inquisition Register describing the period 1273-1282. This mainly involves processes with the Cathars, and to the lesser extent with the Valdensians. In addition to heterodox beliefs, both groups are also characterized by specific rituals (baptism with the Holy Spirit, kissing of peace, etc.). This project examines how testimonies about what people believed and what people did (their ritualized actions, but also ordinary actions) are proportionally represented in individual depositions, but also in the entire corpus. I will carry out the content analysis and partially discourse analysis of the source mainly using computational methods from the field of natural language processing. The goal of the project is to create statistical profiles of the register with regards to selected patterns of religious behaviour and thinking, and I want to interpret these profiles in the broader historical context of the study of medieval religious culture between orthodoxy and heterodoxy. The project can enrich the current knowledge of medieval heterodox groups through quantitative models reflecting the thinking and behaviour of their members and the practice of keeping inquisitional records.
