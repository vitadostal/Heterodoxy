      "Document number 2: In the year of Our Lord one thousand two hundred and eighty - one ,  on the third day before the kalends of May ,  before us , Arnaud , inquisitor of heretical depravity ,  in the city of Carcassonne ,  appeared a certain man named Arnaldus Segarelli , a native of Parma ,  who was accused of preaching heretical doctrines and leading others astray .  When asked by the inquisitor if he had ever preached or taught anything contrary to the Catholic faith ,  he answered that he had not , but that he had sought to follow the example of holy poverty and live a life of simplicity and piety .  He acknowledged that he had gathered a community of like - minded individuals , who lived in charity and shared all that they had with one another .  He also admitted that he referred to himself as a disciple of Christ and that he had been named the \"Angel \" by his followers .  However , he denied that he was the \"Son of God \" or that he claimed to be equal to Christ in any way .\n",
      "\n",
      "The inquisitor pressed Arnaldus to explain some of the teachings that he had spread among his followers , one of which was the belief that the Catholic Church had strayed from its original mission and had become corrupt and materialistic .  Arnaldus also spoke of the need for a spiritual renewal and a return to the simplicity and poverty of the early Christian Church .\n",
      "\n",
      "The inquisitor asked Arnaldus about reports that he had encouraged his followers to reject the sacraments of the Catholic Church and to perform their own religious rites instead .  Arnaldus stated that he had only sought to simplify the religious practices of his followers and had not urged them to reject any essential sacraments .\n",
      "\n",
      "After further questioning , Arnaldus was charged with heresy and imprisoned in the castle of Carcassonne .  He was later tried and found guilty , and was burned at the stake as a heretic on the ninth day before the kalends of May in the same year .\n",

      "This document is a deposition from Petronilla, the wife of Daide of Bras from Villefranche in the diocese of Rodez, who was questioned as a witness in a trial related to heresy. Petronilla stated that she had never seen any heretics, except when she was a little girl, but had never believed or had any dealings with them. She did, however, see a man called William who was a fugitive from heresy and had fled from his land through fear of the inquisitors who had imprisoned his sister and her husband. William had stayed with Petronilla twice, once for two days and once for one night, and had told her that he had fled to Lombardy but had returned after finding a bad set of people there. However, he never mentioned seeing any heretics or speaking with them while he was in Lombardy. Petronilla attested to this before the inquisitor Ranulph, and witnesses to her testimony were Brother William of Labarthe and master Vernet, the rector of the church of Saint-FÃ©lix.\n",

The witnesses to this confession were brother Alexander of the Order of Preachers and Bernard Bonet, a public notary of Toulouse who recorded these events.\n",

When asked about their names, she replied that she did not know, but described them as having long hair and beards, dressed in poor clothes and speaking a language she did not understand. She further confessed that she regretted having helped them and was now willing to reveal everything she knew in order to obtain God's mercy and the forgiveness of her sins. This testimony was recorded and signed by the notary and witnesses present.\n",

Petron-illa was brought out from prison, sworn in as a witness, and asked about her interactions with heretics. She admitted to seeing two heretics in her husband's house and eating and drinking with them. She also admitted to adoring the heretics by genuflecting and saying \"Bless me,\" to which they replied, \"May the Holy Spirit bless you.\" When asked if she believed that the heretics were good and truthful men and that one could be saved through them, she said yes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Petron-illa also testified that Raymonda Aimery was in her husband's house at the time she adored the heretics and that they all ate together. She also admitted to receiving exiles for the matter of heresy as guests in her home, eating and drinking with them, and receiving blessed bread of the heretics brought by a fugitive for the matter of heresy named Amblard Vassal. Amblard also greeted Petron-illa's husband on behalf of Aimery of Collet, the bishop of the heretics. Petron-illa said that both she and her husband received Amblard with great joy. \n",

      "The witness also said that the time when she adored the heretics was about three years ago. A year ago, shortly before the feast of the Blessed John the Baptist, they were brought blessed bread, and two years ago or thereabouts, the same witness saw and received the fugitives named above. The testimony was attested before brother William of Labarthe, acting in place of brother Ranulph, the inquisitor, and witnessed by brother Alexander, of the Order of Preachers, and Sicard Lunel.

      "This document is a confession given by a witness before brother Ranulph, an inquisitor, regarding her involvement with heretics. The witness reveals that she visited her godparents Daide of Bras and Petronilla, who are from Villefranche, and slept in their house. She claims that her godmother said all the things in her house were of the devil and discussed fleeing to Lombardy to join the heretics. The witness also saw her daughter eat the blessed bread of the heretics without knowing they were heretics. Additionally, she admits to receiving a cushion from Galhard Bonet of Villefranche, who fled to Lombardy because he knew William of Castanet was a friend of William the heretic. The witness claims that William of Castanet said that no one could be saved except in the sect of the heretics and all visible things were the works of the devil. She also mentions familiar associates of her husband, including Peter of Frouzins, and other heretics who went to Lombardy. Finally, she admits to falsely confessing to adore heretics in her first confession out of fear. The confession was witnessed by Brother Peter Arsieu, Prior of the Brothers Preacher of Carcassonne, Brother William of Labarthe, Brother Alexander of the Order of Preachers, and Bernard Bonet, a public notary of Toulouse. The witness abjured heresy and took an oath before Brother Ranulph.\n",

The testimony of Gerald of VerdiÃ© from Paulhac is also included.

      "Bernard Rival confesses to having seen and adored heretics Raymond David, Bernard Rastel, and Peter Boer in various locations, including Aurin, the parish of Sainte-Apollonie, Gran Fon, Saint-AndrÃ© of Assers, and the wood of Vacairil. He also admits to having eaten bread blessed by the heretics with his wife and messenger, Gras. Rival recounts a story of how Pons Rastel was sent to Caragoudes to retrieve a wax tablet from Bertrand Alaman, which was to be inscribed with the name of the person the heretics wanted to be ordained as deacon in place of Pons of Sainte-Foy. The tablet was brought to the captive deacon who wrote that William John was to be ordained. The witness also mentioned rumors of Guillelma, the wife of Vital of the mas of Aurinhol, and her son Peter, who may have gone to Lombardy to join the heretics. Despite all this, Bernard Rival believed that the heretics were good and truthful and could provide a path to salvation.\n",

      "In the year mentioned above, on a Sunday in Lent, Bernard of Rival was still in prison and in leg-irons because he had not confessed fully.

      "This document is a concerning snapshot of the mental and emotional state of someone who was held in the Inquisition's custody. Bernard of Rival clearly felt so desperate that he resorted to self-harm. It's impossible to know what led him to that point, but the fact that he was still being held in leg-irons suggests that he may have been subjected to some form of physical or psychological abuse. It's also notable that Atho records the fact that Bernard had not confessed fully, raising the question of what additional information the Inquisition was trying to extract from him. Overall, this document highlights the brutality and trauma that were an integral part of the Inquisition's methods.\n",

Isarn dismounted from his pony, which the witness's father gave to the witness to hold. The witness's father then took him into the nearby Wood of Corneilhan, where he believes they met with heretics Gaucelin and another companion. The witness's father and older brother, Raymond of Saint-Michel, brought food to the heretics and kept them there. Isarn often gave the witness's mother nuts and pears to take and give to the heretics on his behalf. The event happened about 14 years ago.

The witness also stated that he had seen Peter adoring two heretics, William Prunel and his companion, in the same house.

She stated that she had never seen any heretics and had no hope or faith in them. However, she mentioned that her neighbors considered Fabrissa, the wife of Peter Vital, and Philippa, her daughter, both joiners, as suspect of heresy due to their words and actions.\n",

      "Guillelma recounted an occasion when she heard Fabrissa say that Lucifer had made man, and God had instructed him to make the man speak. She also heard Fabrissa speak ill of the clergy and express a desire to leave the country for penance. Guillelma suspected that Placentia, a woman from Lombardy, who came to visit Fabrissa, was a messenger of the heretics. She also witnessed Bernard Fogassier coming to Fabrissa and Philippa's house several times and hiding there.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the death of William Aribaud, who had been imprisoned and marked with the cross for heresy, Fabrissa cried out in lament, saying, 'Holy Father, Holy Father.' Guillelma corrected her, but Fabrissa replied that she was grieving because he had done nothing that he wanted. She also believed that 'worthy men' who had come to keep vigil for William Aribaud might have been heretics who wanted to convert him.\n",

      "Guillelma attested that Raymonda, Fabrissa's mother, kept her illness secret and did not see anyone till the time of her death. Before falling sick, Raymonda had told Guillelma that she trusted her above all and wanted the worthy men to come through her house if needed.\n",

Fabrissa had said that the cleric had disputed with the Brothers Preacher and Minor until the king came, but was then burnt for saying that whoever received the body of the Lord carried it out. Raymonda, Fabrissa's late mother, questioned why the cleric was burnt and said that he was speaking the truth. Guillelma rebuked her and said, \"The devil is making you speak.\"\n",

      "Guillelma also heard Philippa, the daughter of Fabrissa, saying that her grandmother's first husband was burned as a heretic because he refused to kill a certain cock at the command of the inquisitors.

      "This document is a letter from Brother Pons of Parnac, an inquisitor of heretical depravity in the realm of France, to Brother Raymond, prior of the Brothers Preacher of Montauban. The letter is dated on the Sunday after the feast of St Denis in the year 1276. In the letter, Brother Pons informs Brother Raymond that he has received reports that Bernard of Souillac of Montauban has spoken against the orthodox faith. Bernard has reportedly said that the consecrated host on the altar is not the true body of Christ but cooked dough, and that if it were the body of Christ and as large as a large mountain, it would have been consumed long ago. Bernard has also allegedly said that confessing to a priest does not aid salvation and that usury is not a sin. In addition, Bernard has reportedly said that Saracens and Jews have a better faith than Christians. Brother Pons instructs Brother Raymond to carefully examine these claims, question those who have been named, and return their depositions to him under seal.\n",

      "In Document number 120, Julian Angevin is questioned as a witness regarding the statement made by Bernard of Souillac of Montauban. Julian testifies that he heard Bernard say that God would not entrust himself to priests and chaplains, as they are false. He also heard him say that the host carried by priests is not the true body of Christ but cooked dough. Bernard believed that confessing sins to God alone is superior to confessing them to priests, whom he considered to be like cannibals. Furthermore, Bernard did not believe that usury is a sin, but a means of earning a good profit. Julian places the time of this conversation five years ago, between Palm Sunday and Easter, and the location as Bernard's vineyard in Lesquiers, which is in the royal fee. The witnesses to Julian's statement are the prior as well as the brothers Vital of Caubon and Vital Gerald, Atho of Saint-Victor, and Raymond of La Selve, a public notary of Montauban.\n",

Bernard also claimed to have enough of such bread in his chest and that God would not allow himself to be crushed in the hands of such traitorous priests who extort money from people by making three crumbs out of the host. Bernard made these statements in a vineyard belonging to him located near Montauban six years ago, as Brito believes. He also claimed that he did not confess his sins to priests but rather to God the Father in his house against the wall as he knew too well the sins priests committed. Bernard referred to himself as not being a Christian but called Christians \"digeti\" or lepers. Julian Angevin, William Locot, John Boart, John Salomon, William Martin, and John Lococ were present during these statements, according to Brito.

Peter admits to aiding a man named Peter of Beauville, who was a fugitive for heresy, by transporting his wife with the help of Bego of Roqueville, a knight of Montgaillard. Peter also reveals witnessing heretical preaching by Pons of Sainte-Foy and his unknown companion, who he believes to be Peter of Prat, in the hall of Bertrand of Roqueville and Bego, brothers and knights. Alongside these knights were Lady India, Bertrand's wife, Lady Aicelina, Bertrand's mother, Stephen and William Donat, brothers, and Bernard Donadeu of Montgaillard. They all heard the preaching and worshipped the heretics in the presence of Peter of Laurac. Peter of Laurac additionally states that he saw Bernard Colomb and his unknown companion, both heretics, in the solar of the same house and worshipped them with the same group of people. He also saw Peter of Prat and Pons of Sainte-Foy in the same location but did not witness their worship. Finally, he admits to frequently seeing Raymond Vital and his heretical companion in the same chamber and worshipping them with the aforementioned group of people. Peter of Laurac initially believed that the heretics were good and friends of God and that one could be saved through them. It was only after confessing to Pons of Pouget that he abandoned this belief. When asked why he initially hid the truth, Peter responded that he did not feel obligated to share his knowledge since the actions occurred in the house of his lords who were mainly responsible for the heretical behavior. He attests to these claims before Brother Hugh Amiel, an inquisitor, in Toulouse with the presence of Brother James Loutrier, Brother William Aimery of the Order of Preachers, and Atho of Saint-Victor, a public notary who recorded the confession.\n",
